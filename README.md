## Who am I?
Hi! I am Anesha Slaton, a proud graduate of the Cyber and Network Security program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I have taken my skills and experience as an IT Project Manager and have dedicated time and resources to become well-educated as a proactive defensive security professional. I have hands-on experience in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), security policy and standards development, risk management, security audits, and security awareness training.

## üîíWhy Cybersecurity?
My passion for cybersecurity began in May 2021 during the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. During this time, I discovered the value of network and data security. The ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline had a personal impact on me. This unfortunate event fueled a new purpose and opportunity to be part of something pivotal and make a lasting impact.

## üìëMy Resources?
As a Defensive Security professional, staying abreast of current trends is critical.
A few training resources that I leverage daily include [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) and [HackTheBox](https://www/Hackthebox.com/)
When I am looking to stay up-to-date with all the security news, I follow prominent publications such as [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/), [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/), [New York Times Computer and Security News](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/computer-security-cybersecurity), and my favorite resource for all things cybersecurity is from Gerald Augher, PhD of [SimplyCyber.io](https://www.simplycyber.io/).
